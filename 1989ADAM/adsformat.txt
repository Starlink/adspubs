%B ADAM is now a major software project; it provides a fully
   integrated environment for both data reduction and data
   acquisition. It is being used in Hawaii, Australia and the Canary
   Islands, as well as the UK, and has been adopted by Starlink as the
   environment in which Starlink data reduction software should run. One
   of the most remarkable things about ADAM is that it has been
   developed as a co-operative effort between groups that are spread
   across the world. Although the initial system came out of RGO, and
   ROE provided by far the major effort in designing and implementing
   the VAX version, various parts of what is now regarded as 'ADAM' have
   also come from other establishments. Co-ordinating a project being
   developed in this way is not an easy job, but the somewhat varied
   parentage of ADAM - although sometimes an administrative nightmare -
   is also one of its strengths; it is not a system developed in one
   place to serve the specific needs of that one place.

   One way in which this development is co-ordinated is by a series of
   workshops. These have taken place at about 18 month intervals since
   the first one in late 1985. The workshops are attended by people
   actively developing and/or making extensive use of ADAM, and
   provide a forum for detailed discussion of the problems in the
   current system and plans for its extension.

   The 1989 ADAM Workshop was held at Cosener's House, Abingdon from
   3rd to 7th July 1989. An 'Open Meeting' was held on Friday 30th
   June at RAL to enable members of the Starlink community to provide
   input to the Workshop discussions.

   Before the previous workshop, in Hawaii, a trend had started to
   emerge for different establishments to plug the gaps in ADAM
   (which at the time was missing a number of important facilities)
   with local solutions. The Hawaii Workshop consolidated these local
   extensions, adopting some and rejecting others. As a result,
   ADAM, as reviewed by this third workshop, was a much more complete
   and uniform system, and it was possible to start to look in detail
   at the various enhancements that were still needed; in particular,
   to make it efficient as a data reduction environment.

   This document summarises the conclusions and actions arising from
   the Workshop and presents brief reports on the discussions,
   prepared, in most cases, by the session chairmen. Part III consists
   of documents submitted, prior to the Workshop, for consideration
   during it; their content was not necessarily endorsed by the
   Workshop. Part TV consists of those reports and proposals, arising
   out of Workshop action items, which have already been submitted.

%T ADAM Support Group Objectives
%A Wallace, Patrick
%P 51
%L 53
%F AA(Rutherford Appleton Laboratory)
%B At the end of 19S8, Starlink made a successful bid for the creation
   of an ADAM Support Group (ASG). The Group will be composed of five
   people; two of the positions are to be drawn from existing resources
   and three, available from April 1990, are new, including the ASG
   Head. The Group will concentrate mainly on the system aspects of
   ADAM, plus various kernel and template applications. While supporting
   the real-time facilities within ADAM (including performance aspects),
   the ASG will leave online applications software per se to the
   observatories.

   The ASG was initially funded for just three years, after which
   progress is to be assessed and the future of the Group
   reconsidered. The success of the Group will be judged in relation to a
   list of objectives which formed part of the original bid. This list
   forms the rest of this appendix.

%T Some musings on ADAM and ADC
%A Davenhall, Clive
%P 57
%L 61
%F AA(Royal Observatory, Edinburgh)
%B The relation between ADAM and ADC is considered and the following conclusions
   are drawn:
   1. ADC forms a natural part of the ADAM environment.
   2. The ADC subroutine libraries should be fully integrated with ADAM and
      maintained by the ADAM Support Group.
   3. There are no significant advantages in re-implementing ADC to access
      catalogues held inside HDS structures rather than as VMS files.
   4. SCAR applications should be free to use the full ADAM parameter system.

%T Suggested Improvements to the Parameter System
%A Chipperfield, Alan J.
%P 62
%L 66
%F AA(Rutherford Appleton Laboratory)
%B There axe a number of anomalies in the way parameters are obtained,
   leading to confusion amongst programmers and users alike.
   The two main areas of concern are:
   • The way in which parameter state affects the value obtained.
   • The way in which the 'current' value is defined.

%T Time to Raise Cain? - A critique of the VAX ADAM system
%A Jones, Lewis
%P 67
%L 82
%F AA(Royal Greenwich Observatory)
%B The VAX ADAM system presently used by ROE, AAO, Starlink and others
   has been used to build the instrumentation systems for the William
   Herschel Telescope (WHT). Use of 'intelligent' microprocessor-based
   hardware within the WHT observing system, together with a
   fundamental requirement for increased efficiency in the observing
   process, has resulted in a new approach requiring sophisticated
   software in order to implement batch-oriented control. The result
   is that the WHT instrumentation system forms one of the largest and
   most complex implementations within the ADAM environment to date.

   During the design and implementation stages of the WHT
   instrumentation software, the ADAM environment has been found to be
   a less than satisfactory framework within which to construct a
   high-quality observing system to the original specification. This
   document is a distillation of specific problems which have been
   encountered by members of the La Palma Software Group, together
   with other general observations of shortcomings in the current
   implementation of the VAX ADAM environment.

%T Proposal for MAX and MIN Parameter Responses
%A Lupton, William
%P 85
%L 85
%F AA(Anglo Australian Observatory)
%B The Figaro parameter system permits responses of 'MAX' and 'MIN'
   when obtaining numeric values. 'MAX' results in the maximum allowed
   value being returned and 'MIN' results in the minimum aUowed value
   being returned. The appropriate values are specified in the
   argument hst to the parameter reading routine.

   The ADAM parameter system does not support these responses. It is
   necessary to do so in order to be able to provide the user
   interface in the ADAM Figaro monolith that Figaro users will expect.

%R 1990adam.proc...86B
%T Proposal for Multiline HELP on Parameter Prompts
%A Bailey, Jeremy
%P 86
%L 87
%F AA(Joint Astronomy Centre)
%B ADAM allows a '?' response to a parameter prompt, which results in a
   single line of help text, coming from the HELP field of the
   parameter description, being output on the terminal. A single line
   of text is often inadequate to give useful information on the
   parameter. Figaro, for example, allows multiple line HELP information
   under the same circumstances.

   The size of the help text cannot easily be increased. This
   information is stored in the parameter system common blocks, which
   would have to be increased in size substantially. Also the help
   text, along with other information, is passed to the user interface
   as a message, the size of which is limited.

%T Proposal for Interface File Search Path
%A Chipperfield, Alan J.
%P 91
%L 92
%F AA(Rutherford Appleton Laboratory)
%B A user requiring a private version of an interface file has to copy
   the executable image of the task to the same directory as the
   private interface file.

   It was agreed by the 1989 ADAM Workshop that it would be useful if
   interface files were located by looking along a search path
   ADAM_IFL similar to, but distinct from, the ADAM_EXE search path
   used to locate executable images.

   It was recognised that this feature only becomes really useful if
   there was an 'include' feature in interface files so that private
   versions of individual bits within monolith interface files could be
   easily used. This aspect of the problem has not yet been addressed.
