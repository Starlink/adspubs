%T STARLINK Software Collection
%A Rankin,Steve; Lawden, Mike; Bly, Martin
%D 00/2003
%J Starlink User Note 1
%B The Starlink Software Collection is a set of software which is managed
   and distributed by the Starlink Project.  Some of the software was
   written by members of the Project, but some of it comes from outside
   the Project.  This note describes the functions of the individual items
   in the Collection and provides an overview of the software so that
   readers can identify the items they need.

   The software is classified into four main divisions:

   * Packages -- are large collections of programs for people
     who want to analyse, convert, and display data.  They are subdivided
     into eleven classes to help you find what you want.

   * Utilities -- are small programs devoted to a specific
     purpose.  For example, they help you prepare for observations, write
     documents, and write programs.

   * Subroutine Libraries -- are for programmers writing
     astronomical software.  They provide facilities such as astronomical
     calculations, data management and graphics.

   * Infrastructure -- are items which are mainly of interest to
     people writing programs within the Starlink Software Environment.  They
     are included for completeness.

   Each item is described in sufficient detail for you to decide whether or
   not to investigate it further.
   If you want to find out more about an item, follow the document references
   given opposite the item name.
   If you are using the hypertext version of this document, the most up-to-date
   document references can be found by following the link from the software item
   name.

%A Privett, G. J.; Gold, J.; Fuller, N.; Lewis, J.; Benn, C.
%D 00/1996
%J Starlink User Note 19
%B NDPROGS is a set of programs which perform basic manipulation and display
   functions on images with up to six dimensions.
   The programs were written at the RGO, primarily for the
   manipulation of TAURUS spectral line data cubes, but they contain
   no instrument-specific features and can therefore be used in the
   analysis of other similar data.

   The term `image' as used in this note simply means a regular data
   array, which might be anything from a 1-D spectrum or profile to a 4-D
   array consisting of several long-slit spectra with polarization vectors.

%B The Extensible N-Dimensional Data Format (NDF) is a format for
   storing bulk data in the form of N-dimensional arrays of numbers. It
   is typically used for storing spectra, images and similar datasets
   with higher dimensionality. The NDF format is based on the
   Hierarchical Data System (HDS) (SUN/92) and is
   extensible; not only does it provide a comprehensive set of standard
   ancillary items to describe the data, it can also be extended
   indefinitely to handle additional user-defined information of any
   type.

   This document describes the routines provided for accessing NDF data
   objects. It also discusses all the important NDF concepts and includes
   a selection of simple example applications.

   IRCAMDR (the old IRCAM CLRED updated to work under Unix
   and renamed) will analyse and display any 2D data image with a .sdf
   file extension stored in the standard Starlink NDF data format.

   It reduces and analyses IRCAM1/2 data images of 62x58
   pixels and IRCAM3 images of 256x256 size.  Almost all the
   applications (with the exception of med3d) will work on NDF
   images of any physical (pixel) dimensions, for example,
   1024x1024 CCD images can be processed (med3d median
   filters stacks of images up to 256x256 in size at present).

%J Starlink User Note 62
%B The programs described in this document provide the mechanism for
   producing ASTERIX (HDS) datasets from Wide Field Camera data collected
   during the pointed phase of the ROSAT mission. A sort program generates
   ASTERIX datasets (e.g., time series, images, etc.,) from
   pre-processed event data supplied as part of the Rosat WFC Observation
   Datasets (RWODs). An exposure program corrects these datasets allowing
   for instrument characteristics. In addition a simple database manager
   allows an index of RWODs to be maintained and searched.  The programs
   make use of the ADAM and ICL environment and a number of ICL procedures
   have been provided to perform some of the more commonly required
   operations such as extracting background subtracted lightcurves.

   WFCPACK is supported under Digital Unix on DEC Alpha AXP, and under
   Solaris 2.x on Sun SPARC.  There is no longer a VAX/VMS version.  The
   old VAX RWOD which consisted of several VMS format specific files has
   been replaced with a single HDS file that is easily transportable
   between the various UNIX flavours.

%D 00/2008
%J Starlink User Note 92
%B HDS is a file-based hierarchical data system designed for the storage
   of a wide variety of information. It is particularly suited to the
   storage of large multi-dimensional arrays (with their ancillary data)
   where efficient access is needed.

   HDS organises data into hierarchies, broadly
   similar to the directory structure of a hierarchical filing system,
   but contained within a single HDS container file. The structures
   stored in these files are self-describing and flexible; HDS supports
   modification and extension of structures previously created, as well
   as deletion, copying, renaming, etc.

   All information stored in HDS files is portable between the machines
   on which HDS is implemented. Thus, there are no format conversion
   problems when moving between machines.

   The routines described in this document
   may be used to perform operations on any HDS data. In addition, HDS
   forms a toolkit for the construction of higher level (more
   specialised) data structures and the software which accesses them.
   HDS routines are therefore invoked indirectly by many other items of
   Starlink software.

%B KAPPA is an applications package comprising about 180
   general-purpose commands for image processing, data visualisation, and
   manipulation of the standard Starlink data format---the NDF.  It is
   intended to work in conjunction with Starlink's various specialised
   packages.

   In addition to the NDF, KAPPA can also process data in
   other formats by using the `on-the-fly' conversion scheme.  Many
   commands can process data arrays of arbitrary dimension, and others
   work on both spectra and images. KAPPA operates from
   both the UNIX C-shell and the ICL command language.

   This document describes how to use KAPPA and its
   features.  There is some description of techniques too, including a
   section on writing scripts.  This document includes several tutorials
   and is illustrated with numerous examples.  The bulk of this document
   comprises detailed descriptions of each command as well as classified
   and alphabetical summaries.

%A Currie, Malcolm J.; Chipperfield, Alan J.
%D 00/1999
%J Starlink User Note 114
%B PAR is a library of Fortran subroutines that
   provides convenient mechanisms for applications to exchange information with
   the outside world, through input-output channels called parameters.
   Parameters enable a user to control an application's behaviour.  PAR supports numeric,
   character, and logical parameters, and is currently implemented
   only on top of the ADAM parameter system.

   The PAR library permits parameter values to be obtained, without or with
   a variety of constraints.  Results may be put into parameters to
   be passed onto other applications.  Other facilities include setting a prompt
   string, and suggested defaults.

   This document also introduces a preliminary C interface for the PAR library
   -- this may be subject to change in the light of experience.

%B CCDPACK is a package of programs for reducing CCD-like data. They
   allow you to debias, remove dark current, flatfield, register,
   resample and normalize data from single- or multiple-CCD instruments.

   CCDPACK is designed to help you to reduce your data easily.
   The basic reduction stages can be set up using an X based GUI that
   controls an automated reduction system.
   The GUI is designed to allow you to start working without any
   detailed knowledge of the package (or indeed of CCD reduction).
   Registration is performed using graphical, script based or automated
   techniques that help reduce the amount of work to a minimum.

   This document is intended for all users of CCDPACK.
   It provides instruction in how to use CCDPACK, describes CCD reduction
   in general and contains complete descriptions of the individual
   programs.

%B This is a brief introduction to the Unix operating system as it is
   used in the Starlink Project. It is aimed at users who are new to Unix
   and to Starlink. Its purpose is to get you started quickly, so it is
   simple rather than comprehensive.

   It should be read in conjunction with any local guides provided at
   your local Starlink Site -- these give details of the local facilities
   available and how to use them. This is important because Starlink
   Sites differ in their computer hardware and in their versions of Unix.

   A ``Quick Reference Card" is available which summarises the contents of this

   of the star, the telescope (you can also specify arbitrary locations),
   and the year. On the selected GKS graphics device a plot will be drawn
   that tells you, for all dates of the year, the star rising and setting
   times and the times that it is 30 degrees above the  horizon, the
   times of astronomical twilight, the phase and rising and setting  times
   of the Moon as well as its distance from the star in question.

%D 00/1992
%J Starlink User Note 148
%B This note describes a small set of programs, written at RGO, which deal with
   basic CCD frame processing (e.g. bias subtraction, flat fielding, trimming
   etc.).  The need to process large numbers of CCD frames from devices such as
   FOS or ISIS in order to extract spectra has prompted the writing of routines
   which will do the basic hack-work with a minimal amount of interaction from the
   user. Although they were written with spectral data in mind, there are no
   ``spectrum-specific'' features in the software which means they can be applied
   to any CCD data.

%B In this note a description is given of SAM, a package written at RGO for the
   extraction of spectra from two dimensional data frames.  The need to extract
   spectra from two dimensional frames in an optimal manner (e.g. one in which the
   signal to noise ratio was maximised) was the primary reason for the writing of
   the package. The programs were originally written with FOS, ISIS and IDS in
   mind, but contain nothing which  is instrument specific and hence should be
   applicable to any two dimensional spectral data frame.

   control the allocation of the tape drive and the physical mounting of the tape
   on systems which provide that facility.

   The library is currently supported for Sun Sparcstations running Solaris and
   for DEC Alphas running OSF/1. Historically it has been supported for DEC
   Ultrix and for SunOS and may still work for them.

   The library is also available for VAX/VMS systems.

%J Starlink User Note 174
%B This document is a guide to on-line bibliographic databases and other
   information services which might be useful to astronomers. It
   concentrates on facilities which are either provided within the
   astronomical community, or which are available free of charge. For
   each facility listed a brief description is given, together with details
   of how to access it and how to obtain further information about it.
   The document aims to provide sufficient information for you to decide
   which facilities will be useful to you, and then obtain further
   information on them, rather than providing comprehensive documentation
   for each facility. It should be possible to access most of the
   facilities described here from Starlink computers. This document is
   complementary to SUN/162 which describes some of the observation and
   data archives available on-line.

   intended for programmers who plan to write applications which use the
   CAT library to manipulate such datasets. It is introductory in the
   sense that it contains sufficient information to enable a programmer new

   the library intended for use in conjunction with the Starlink ADAM
   programming environment is described. All the subroutines in the

   shapes (boxes, circles, lines, etc.). These keywords can be combined together
   using Boolean-style operators (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to create more complex
   shapes. Data arrays can be multi-dimensional.

%D 00/2010
%J Starlink User Note 188
%B This document describes a set of ``Hypertext Cross-Reference
   Utilities'' (HTX) which are designed to help maintain large
   documentation sets whose constituent documents are written
   using the Hypertext Markup Languagee (HTML).

   The central part of HTX is a hypertext linker, hlink.
   This allows hyper-links (or cross-references)
   to be established between related documents in such a way that it is
   easy to maintain their integrity as individual documents are updated.
   Information produced by this linking process is also used by other HTX
   utilities to provide document
   search facilities and the ability to
   randomly access any part of a
   documentation set. This latter capability forms a basis for
   constructing hypertext help systems for
   use by other software.

   The expected readership of this document includes those who read
   hypertext documentation, those who write it, and those who maintain
   it, especially those who write and maintain Starlink
   documentation. Software developers may also be interested in
   the possibilities for hypertext help that HTX provides.

   catalogue coordinates between some celestial coordinate systems, plotting
   finding charts and photometric calibration.  Also, subsets can be extracted
   from a catalogue in a format suitable for plotting using other Starlink
   packages, such as PONGO.  CURSA can access catalogues held in the popular
   FITS table format, the Tab-Separated Table (TST) format or the Small Text
   List (STL) format.  Catalogues in the STL and TST formats are simple ASCII
   text files.  CURSA also includes some facilities for accessing remote

   The library is not intended as a service to Starlink users or as a
   full NAG replacement, but some users may find routines in this library
   useful.

   The library is coded in Fortran and has a Fortran 77 binding. Mostly,
   the interface is for double precision, the Fourier transform part
   provides for both double and single precision, and the routines from
   DIERCKX exist only for single precision.

%B Star2HTML lets you write (or convert) a Starlink document
   so that you can create two versions of it from a single source file.
   A paper version is produced by LaTeX,
   and a hypertext version (suitable for browsing on the web) is produced by
   latex2html.
   You can tailor each version to its own medium by marking selected text as
   LaTeX-only or HTML-only.

   Star2HTML also includes a set of document templates for producing
   Starlink documents in a standard style (such as Starlink User Note).
   They also define new LaTeX commands for adding extra links to the
   hypertext version of your document (without affecting the paper version).

   This document explains these new facilities, and gives advice on good
   practice and on how to deal with some specific formatting problems when
   converting a document to hypertext.

%J Starlink User Note 207
%B The NRAO Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) is a software
   package for interactive (and, optionally, batch) calibration and
   editing of radio interferometric data and for the calibration,
   construction, display and analysis of astronomical images made from
   those data using Fourier synthesis methods.  It is the principle tool
   for display and analysis of both two- and three-dimensional radio
   images (i.e., continuum ``maps'' and spectral-line ``cubes''
   from the NRAO's Very Large Array (VLA) as well as MERLIN data.

   It is also used for astronomical applications that do not involve radio
   interferometry.  These uses include the display and analysis of line
   and continuum data from large single-dish radio surveys, and the
   processing of image data at infrared, visible, ultraviolet and X-ray
   wavelengths.

%A McGale, P.; West, Richard

%J Starlink User Note 208
%B During 1990 Jul to 1991 Jan, the ROSAT Wide Field Camera (WFC) performed
   the first all-sky survey at extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths.
   The whole sky, or approximately 96% of it, was imaged in two passbands, S1
   and S2, covering the ranges 60-140 Angstroms and 110-200 Angstroms respectively.
   An initial bright source catalogue (BSC) of 383 sources was produced by
   Pounds et al.  A new list, the 2RE Catalogue,
   of 479 sources has recently been
   published.  The survey data i.e., images and `raw' photon event files
   are now in the public domain.  The REPACK software package has been
   developed to fully exploit these data.  This document describes the
   REPACK programs.

%A Davenhall, A. C.
%D 00/2002
%J Starlink User Note 235
%B Observations made with the NAOMI adaptive optics system on the
   William Herschel Telescope (WHT) usually require a guide star located
   close to the target object being observed.  This manual describes how to
   find such guide stars.  It documents the NAOS package whose purpose is
   precisely to find suitable guide stars and also describes various related
   items of software.  Details of the potential guide stars are produced as
   tabular lists in text files, finding charts and tables in a format
   suitable for input into GAIA or CURSA.

   This document is aimed at astronomers who are planning to observe
   with the NAOMI adaptive optics system on the WHT and need to find guide
   stars for their target objects.

%J Starlink User Note 247
%B XRT is a package for reducing data acquired with the ROSAT XRT
   instruments.  The XRT (X-Ray Telescope) was the principal scientific
   payload of the ROSAT X-ray astronomy satellite.  The XRT had two
   instruments: the PSPC (Position Sensitive Proportional Counter) and the
   HRI (High Resolution Imager).  The XRT package operates on data produced
   by these instruments and can be used to transform them into calibrated
   images, spectra, time-series etc.

   XRT was created by taking the ROSAT XRT-specific functions in the ASTERIX
   general X-ray astronomy data reduction system and re-packaging them as
   stand-alone applications.

%T STIL - Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library
%A Taylor, Mark
%D 00/2013
%J Starlink User Note 252
%B STIL is a set of Java class libraries which allow input,
   manipulation and output of tabular data and metadata. Among its key
   features are support for many tabular formats (including VOTable,
   FITS, CDF, text-based formats and SQL databases) and support for
   dealing with very large tables in limited memory.

   As well as an abstract and format-independent definition of what
   constitutes a table, and an extensible framework for "pull-model"
   table processing, it provides a number of format-specific handlers
   which know how to serialize/deserialize tables. The framework for
   interaction between the core table manipulation facilities and the
   format-specific handlers is open and pluggable, so that handlers
   for new formats can easily be added, programmatically or at
   run-time.

   The VOTable handling in particular is provided by classes which
   perform efficient XML parsing and can read and write VOTables in
   any of the defined formats (TABLEDATA, BINARY or FITS). It supports
   table-aware SAX- or DOM-mode processing and may be used on its own
   for VOTable I/O without much reference to the format-independent
   parts of the library.

%T TOPCAT -- Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables
%A Taylor, Mark
%D 00/2013
%J Starlink User Note 253
%B TOPCAT is an interactive graphical viewer and editor for tabular
   data. It has been designed for use with astronomical tables such as
   object catalogues, but is not restricted to astronomical
   applications. It understands a number of different astronomically
   important formats, and more formats can be added. It is designed to
   cope well with large tables; a million rows by a hundred columns
   should not present a problem even with modest memory and CPU
   resources.

   It offers a variety of ways to view and analyse the data, including
   a browser for the cell data themselves, viewers for information
   about table and column metadata, tools for joining tables using
   flexible matching algorithms, and visualisation facilities
   including histograms, 2- and 3-dimensional scatter plots, and
   density maps. Using a powerful and extensible Java-based expression
   language new columns can be defined and row subsets selected for
   separate analysis. Selecting a row can be configured to trigger an
   action, for instance displaying an image of the catalogue object in
   an external viewer. Table data and metadata can be edited and the
   resulting modified table can be written out in a wide range of
   output formats.

   A number of options are provided for loading data from external
   sources, including Virtual Observatory (VO) services, thus
   providing a gateway to many remote archives of astronomical
   data. It can also interoperate with other desktop tools using the
   SAMP protocol.

   TOPCAT is written in pure Java and is available under the GNU
   General Public Licence. Its underlying table processing facilities
   are provided by STIL, the Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library.

%B STILTS is a set of command-line tools for processing tabular data.
   It has been designed for, but is not restricted to, use on
   astronomical data such as source catalogues.  It contains both
   generic (format-independent) table processing tools and tools for
   processing VOTable documents.  Facilities offered include
   crossmatching, format conversion, format validation, column
   calculation and rearrangement, row selection, sorting, plotting,
   statistical calculations and metadata display.  Calculations on
   cell data can be performed using a powerful and extensible
   expression language.

   The package is written in pure Java and based on STIL, the Starlink
   Tables Infrastructure Library.  This gives it high portability,
   support for many data formats (including FITS, VOTable, text-based
   formats and SQL databases), extensibility and scalability.  Where
   possible the tools are written to accept streamed data so the size
   of tables which can be processed is not limited by available
   memory.  As well as the tutorial and reference information in this
   document, detailed on-line help is available from the tools
   themselves.

%B The present procedure for reporting bugs in the Starlink Software Collection is
   thought by many to be unsatisfactory. The purpose of this document is to outline
   the procedures to be followed by the person discovering the bug, the Starlink
   Software Librarian and the person to whom the bug is reported. In the past,
   bug reports have seemed to disappear down a black hole, with a fix (maybe)
   appearing, without warning, sometime later. This was generally due to a lack of
   communication on all parts and it is hoped that the procedures outlined below
   will keep all users informed of the progress of a bug through the system.

%J Starlink General Paper 7
%B In order to exploit the most cost-effective hardware and to
   maintain compatibility with the international community, Starlink has
   begun introducing Unix-based computers.  A mixed Unix/VMS service, with
   its extra system management and software support costs, will not be
   efficient in the long term, and over the next few years the existing
   VMS service will run down and a complete change to Unix will occur.
   The details and timing of this transition will vary from site to site in
   accordance with local needs and conditions.  However, as far as possible
   all future hardware purchases will be Unix-based.  As representatives of
   the user community, the Starlink Users' Committee has worked closely
   with the Project in formulating these plans and firmly endorses them.

   The experiment was successful in that we succeeded in running a KAPPA
   application (ADD) as a module in an AVS network without modifying the
   applications program code in any way. We took many short cuts and it became
   clear that doing the job properly would be a major exercise, but we
   learned enough to know that the job is feasible and gained a clear idea of
   what the final system would look like and what it would be capable of.

%D 00/1987
%J Starlink General Paper 13
%B he purpose of this paper is to announce to the astronomical community the
   present plans for the development of applications software within Starlink.
   The paper follows widespread consultation with astronomers---through a survey
   carried out in December 1979, visits to many university departments and
   establishments during the first half of 1980 and a workshop held in June 1980.
   In some areas we can be more specific than others and no doubt plans and
   priorities will undergo major revision as time passes.
   We believe that widespread and up-to-date knowledge of the intentions and
   progress of work on applications is essential if we are effectively to harness
   the effort and expertise available amongst UK astronomers and to maintain
   uniformity of style and high standards everywhere.
   Comments on these proposals and continual feedback as Starlink develops will
   therefore be greatly appreciated.

   requirements for Starlink-supported applications software but are equally
   appropriate for private programming.  The standard applies mainly
   to the implementation of freestanding VAX/VMS and Unix
   applications, but also includes some material specific to developing
   programs for the Starlink ADAM Software Environment.

   Most of the recommendations made here have been available since
   the appearance of the first edition in June 1981.
   Apart from a few additions in August 1984, Starlink's advice
   on general FORTRAN coding standards has not changed.
   Recent versions of this document
   have contained additional material on use
   of graphics and on writing ADAM applications.

   to spend time and effort on a document in order to save the reader time

   it up to that individual to set up the consultative machinery
   appropriate to his or her community.  Sites normally opt
   to set up committees much like the old LMCs or AMCs, but adapted
   to suit local needs.

   A prospective Site Chairman proposes and agrees with the Starlink
   Project Scientist local procedures for consulting
   and representing users which are acceptable to both Starlink and
   the Institution.  The effectiveness of these procedures is
   kept under review; accreditation of the Site Chairman is

   CD-ROMs.

   It does not cover Base Set software, nor does it detail the use of
   Starlink standard makefiles, and does not specify the mechanics of the
   procedures, which evolve with operational demands.

%T Plan for Starlink Software Distribution
%A Bly, M. J.
%D 00/1997
%J Starlink General Paper 52
%B This paper outlines changes to the Starlink Software Distribution system.

   The new scheme is based on a twice-yearly release of the whole Unix
   Starlink Software Collection (USSC) on CD-ROM backed up by releases of
   bug fixes using the Starlink Software Store.  Development versions of
   the USSC will be maintained at RAL and made available to sites hosting
   contract programmers.  Information files and management documentation
   will be distributed monthly using a simplified version of the current
   distribution system.  Commercial software will be distributed using a
   modified version of the current distribution system, to coincide with
   CD-ROM releases.
