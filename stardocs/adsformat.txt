%J Starlink User Note 1
%B The Starlink Software Collection is a set of software which is managed
   and distributed by the Starlink Project.  Some of the software was
   written by members of the Project, but some of it comes from outside
   the Project.  This note describes the functions of the individual items
   in the Collection and provides an overview of the software so that
   readers can identify the items they need.

   The software is classified into four main divisions:

   * Packages -- are large collections of programs for people
     who want to analyse, convert, and display data.  They are subdivided
     into eleven classes to help you find what you want.

   * Utilities -- are small programs devoted to a specific
     purpose.  For example, they help you prepare for observations, write
     documents, and write programs.

   * Subroutine Libraries -- are for programmers writing
     astronomical software.  They provide facilities such as astronomical
     calculations, data management and graphics.

   * Infrastructure -- are items which are mainly of interest to
     people writing programs within the Starlink Software Environment.  They
     are included for completeness.

   Each item is described in sufficient detail for you to decide whether or
   not to investigate it further.
   If you want to find out more about an item, follow the document references
   given opposite the item name.
   If you are using the hypertext version of this document, the most up-to-date
   document references can be found by following the link from the software item
   name.

%T INTERIM -- Starlink Software Environment
%A Pearce, Dave; Pavelin, Cliff; Lawden, M. D.
%D 00/1989
%J Starlink User Note 4
%B Early versions of this paper were based on a number of other papers produced
   at a very early stage of the Starlink project.
   They contained a description of a specific implementation of a subroutine
   library, speculations on the desirable attributes of a software environment,
   and future development plans.
   They reflected the experimental nature of the Starlink software environment
   at that time.
   Since then, the situation has changed.
   The implemented subroutine library, INTERIM_DIR:INTERIM.OLB, is now a well
   established and widely used piece of software.
   A completely new Starlink software environment (ADAM) has been developed and
   distributed.
   Thus the library released in 1980 as `STARLINK' and now called `INTERIM' has
   reached the end of its development cycle and is now frozen in its current state,
   apart from bug corrections.
   This paper has, therefore, been completely rewritten and restructured to reflect
   the new situation.
   Its aim is to describe the facilities of the INTERIM subroutine library as
   clearly and concisely as possible.
   It avoids speculation, discussion of design decisions, and announcements of
   future plans.

%B Astronomers often have to contend with data that is incomplete in the sense
   that it contains upper or lower limits. This is known as censored data. The
   term `survival statistics' comes from their use in testing objects to find
   their average lifetime without actually testing all the objects to destruction.
   ASURV is a program that performs statistical calculations on such data.

%T IRASLRS -- Obtaining Spectra from the IRAS LRS Database
%A Walker, H; Giaretta, D.
%D 00/1989
%J Starlink User Note 14
%B The IRAS LRS (Low Resolution Spectrograph) database contains about
   170,000 spectra for about 40,000 sources.
   The LRS Atlas contains the ``best'' averaged spectra for 5425 sources, so
   there are a lot of new spectra; some good, some rubbish.
   The LRS operates from around 7$mum to 24mum, using a blue and red
   channel, with some overlap around 12mum to 13mum.
   There are 100 sample points in each channel.
   The LRS is a slitless spectrograph, so extended sources and multiple sources
   confuse the blue and the red channels.
   During the IRAS mission, whenever a sufficiently bright point source
   triggered the algorithm, the spectrum was extracted from the LRS datastream
   and stored in the LRS dataset.
   This means that, although the source may not be in the Point Source Catalog
   (but in the Rejects file) the spectra are still in the dataset.

   The program to average the spectra, and output them, started life as a batch
   program on an old IBM main-frame.
   Parts of this program are the original pieces used to create the LRS Atlas,
   and by setting flags appropriately you could recreate the Atlas.
   The original program was written by E. Raimond, F. Olnon, K. Lugtenberg.
   The program was modified to run ``interactively'' on a Vax (at Groningen)
   by P. te Lintel, and he added a radio astronomy plotting package, POPS, to it.
   The present copy was sent to H. Walker (at NASA Ames) by P. Wesselius, and
   now, having been loaded onto STADAT, the Ames command procedures have been
   modified by D. Giaretta.
   This warns you that the package is fragile, and temperamental.
   There is a complete user manual available, in the [iraslrs] directory.

%B NDPROGS is a set of programs which perform basic manipulation and display

   The programs were written at the RGO, primarily for the
   manipulation of TAURUS spectral line data cubes, but they contain
   no instrument-specific features and can therefore be used in the
   analysis of other similar data.

   The term `image' as used in this note simply means a regular data
   array, which might be anything from a 1-D spectrum or profile to a 4-D
   array consisting of several long-slit spectra with polarization vectors.

%T ULDA/USSP -- Accessing the IUE Uniform Low-Dispersion Archive
%A Murray, M. J.; Stickland, D.J.
%D 00/1993
%J Starlink User Note 20
%B The usefulness of the data collected by the IUE satellite
   has been enormously enhanced by the maintenance of a data archive
   from which interested astronomers can request any image (subject
   to the six-month data retrieval rule). See SUN/58 for details.
   Most UK astronomers now reduce their IUE data from the photometric
   images available in the archive using IUEDR (SUN/37).   However,
   it is now possible to obtain reduced low-resolution spectra on-line.
   These data have been reduced in a fairly
   homogenous way using the IUE Project's Spectral Image Processing System
   (IUESIPS),
   and have been made available in the form of a Uniform Low-Dispersion
   Archive (ULDA).
   This comprises absolutely-calibrated,  extracted, low-dispersion
   spectra corrected for exposure times and with the appropriate  ITF correction
   (flux in ergs cm^-2  s^-1 Angstroms^-1).
   A full description of the data is given in the ESA IUE Newsletter No.~30,
   July 1988,
   and a comparison of the ULDA with IUEDR products is featured in
   the Starlink Bulletin, no. 4.

   In order to facilitate access to the ULDA, the {\it ULDA Software Support
   Package} (USSP) has been developed.
   The USSP enables astronomers to select interactively
   any images contained in the ULDA and provides facilities for efficient
   intercomputer data transfer.
   The USSP enables the searching of the ULDA

   For example, images can be selected on object class, image number, camera,
   aperture,  homogeneous ID,
   sky position or any combination of these attributes.

   Whilst the programme is a general purpose one for use with any type of
   document, it is at present supplied with the templates for telescope time
   application documents.

   The user may make other documents, by making her own template and input
   forms, following the directions given herein.

   To simplify this description of the programme, this document
   assumes that the user intends to use it for making telescope time
   application forms.

%T CLUSTAN -- A Cluster-Analysis Package
%A Currie, Malcolm J.; Parker, Quentin A.
%D 00/1993
%J Starlink User Note 26
%B Astronomers have not, in the past, been among the most imaginative and
   swift group when it came to realising the potentials afforded by
   20th century progress in statistics. However, this is now
   changing and an increasing number of astronomical papers are
   turning to modern statistical analysis techniques to assist in data exploration
   and description (e.g. see Murtagh \& Heck 1987, for a list of
   references).

   A very convincing case highlighting the need for a proper statistical
   methodology in astronomy has been given by Heck et al. (1985),
   and details of the applications of such a methodology have been given by
   Murtagh (1986). Heck et al. stressed that the most important
   statistical methods for modern astronomical problems are probably the
   multivariate methods such as principal-components analysis (PCA) and
   cluster analysis. Astronomers are now realising that ways are urgently
   needed to adequately handle, condense and interpret the huge and growing
   quantities of data currently being produced from our telescopes,
   instruments, satellites and measuring machines.

   To assist UK astronomers working at the forefront in these areas
   Starlink has purchased an integrated commercial package
   CLUSTAN, which performs sophisticated Cluster Analysis and Multivariate
   statistical analysis techniques. It is available at the following sites:
   Birmingham, Cambridge, Durham, Leicester, Manchester, Preston, Queen
   Mary and Westfield College, RAL, ROE, and Southampton.  Users at other
   Starlink sites can access CLUSTAN on STADAT.  They will need to
   ask their site manager to obtain a manual for their site from the
   Starlink Software Librarian.

%B The Extensible N-Dimensional Data Format (NDF) is a format for
   storing bulk data in the form of N-dimensional arrays of numbers. It
   is typically used for storing spectra, images and similar datasets
   with higher dimensionality. The NDF format is based on the
   Hierarchical Data System (HDS) (SUN/92) and is
   extensible; not only does it provide a comprehensive set of standard
   ancillary items to describe the data, it can also be extended
   indefinitely to handle additional user-defined information of any
   type.

   This document describes the routines provided for accessing NDF data
   objects. It also discusses all the important NDF concepts and includes
   a selection of simple example applications.

   The main uses of the network are to provide access for remote users (i.e. users
   not situated at a Starlink site), communication between users by electronic
   mail, and the transfer of modestly sized files (i.e. software and documentation
   rather than data).

   It is not intended that the network should be used for users at one node to
   access facilities at another
   (apart from using the database machine at RAL)
   and it is not normal for a user to have usernames
   on more than one node, although in certain special circumstances this may

%A Bly, M. J.; Allan, P. M.
%D 00/1996
%J Starlink User Note 38
%B One of the recurrent problems with Starlink is that as the volume of
   software grows, so does the number of documents describing it.  These
   include project wide documents and documents which are local to other
   sites.  It is often extremely difficult to find out which document
   should be consulted about a particular topic.

   Starlink maintains a list of currently valid project wide documents
   called `STARLINK DOCUMENTATION' in the file /star/docs/docs\_lis.
   This may be printed if required.  It is maintained at RAL by the
   Starlink Software Librarian and updated at other sites by the Starlink
   software update process.  The current date is stated at the beginning of
   the file so you can see if your site is up to date by comparing your
   site's file with the RAL file available via the WWW.

   An alternative approach is to consult file /star/docs/subject\_lis.
   This is a Key-Word index to Starlink documentation which does not rely
   only on document titles.  Once again, it is maintained up to date at RAL
   but other sites may lag behind.  The specified current date will tell all.
   /star/docs/analysis\_lis is also centrally maintained.  This is a
   list of the Starlink documents listed by which Software item is the main
   subject of each document.

   The docfind program has been developed to help users search this
   mass of information.

%D 00/1989
%J Starlink User Note 43
%B EDFITS is a program used at AAO to copy and edit FITS tapes.  Since it is
   designed to be used with original data tapes, it has a slightly unusual
   style which places a heavy emphasis on making as sure as possible that you
   are not doing anything rash---such as mounting an input tape with a write
   ring fitted---and that you understand the consequences of the commands
   given.  So, for example, after most commands the effect that the command will
   have is described and you are asked to confirm the command before it is
   executed.  Apart from its ability to produce usefully formatted header listings
   for a variety of flavours of FITS tapes, EDFITS provides little that cannot
   be done with standard tape manipulation programs such as MTCOPY.  However,
   you may find its particular style to your taste, and may come to appreciate
   the way it makes it that little bit more difficult to mess up a FITS tape
   copy.

%B The International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite (IUE) is one of the
   most successful, versatile and productive astronomical satellites, providing
   ultraviolet spectra of a wide range of sources for the whole astronomical
   community.

   The UK hosts one of the three full archives of IUE data
   which is supported and maintained by members of the UK IUE
   Project in the Space Science Department at RAL.
   The archive comprises some 100,000 images,
   and a catalogue which gives details of the exposures.
   The aim is to provide UK astronomers with quick and painless
   access to IUE data.

   This document describes how to interrogate the catalogue and extract data from
   the archive. There is also a subsidiary archive of extracted low-resolution spectra, the
   Uniform Low Dispersion Archive,
   which is described in SUN/20: ULDA/USSP - Accessing the IUE ULDA.

%B The programs described in this document provide the mechanism for
   producing ASTERIX (HDS) datasets from Wide Field Camera data collected
   during the pointed phase of the ROSAT mission. A sort program generates
   ASTERIX datasets (e.g., time series, images, etc.,) from
   pre-processed event data supplied as part of the Rosat WFC Observation
   Datasets (RWODs). An exposure program corrects these datasets allowing
   for instrument characteristics. In addition a simple database manager
   allows an index of RWODs to be maintained and searched.  The programs
   make use of the ADAM and ICL environment and a number of ICL procedures
   have been provided to perform some of the more commonly required
   operations such as extracting background subtracted lightcurves.

   WFCPACK is supported under Digital Unix on DEC Alpha AXP, and under
   Solaris 2.x on Sun SPARC.  There is no longer a VAX/VMS version.  The
   old VAX RWOD which consisted of several VMS format specific files has
   been replaced with a single HDS file that is easily transportable
   between the various UNIX flavours.

%A Page, Clive G.
%D 00/1993
%J Starlink User Note 69
%B The compact disc is an increasingly popular medium for the distribution
   of astronomical data, especially for large files such as source
   catalogues and images. CDs can be pressed cheaply in quantity and hold
   around 600 megabytes each.  ISO 9660 specifies a standard physical
   layout and file structure which is almost universally used (although DEC
   is a notable exception). The advent of recordable CD-ROM may provide us
   with an inexpensive and convenient archiving medium.

   Although CD-ROM readers such as DEC's RRD40 are physically capable of
   reading these discs, VMS cannot (at present) cope with the ISO 9660 file
   structure. DEC have produced an alternative device driver in an attempt
   to overcome this limitation but it does not handle the file
   characteristics satisfactorily, and the software is unreliable and
   unsupported. There are rumours that the next major release of VMS will
   include proper support for ISO standard CD-ROMs. Until then, the
   CDCOPY program described here is probably the best alternative for
   VAX/VMS users. It can copy files from ISO 9660 discs to other devices
   and provides several options for format conversion on the fly.

%A Clayton, C. A.; Wilkins, T. N.
%D 00/1991
%B The Honeywell model 3000 colour graphic recorder system (hereafter referred to
   simply as Honeywell) has been bought by Starlink for producing publishable
   quality photographic hardcopy from the IKON image displays. Full colour and
   black & white images can be recorded on positive or negative 35mm film.
   The Honeywell consists of a built-in high resolution flat-faced monochrome
   video monitor, a red/green/blue colour filter mechanism and a 35mm camera.

   The device works on the direct video signals from the IKON. This means that
   changing the brightness or contrast on the IKON monitor will not affect any
   photographs that you take. The video signals from the IKON consist of separate
   red, green and blue signals. When you take a picture, the Honeywell takes the
   red, green and blue signals in turn and displays three pictures consecutively
   on its internal monitor. It takes an exposure through each of three filters
   (red, green and blue) onto the film in the camera. This builds up the complete
   colour picture on the film.

   Honeywell systems are installed at nine Starlink sites, namely Belfast
   (locally funded), Birmingham, Cambridge, Durham, Leicester, Manchester,
   Rutherford, ROE and UCL.

   indexing system. The layout has been revised by M D Lawden but the text mostly derives from 1981
   and so may no longer be fully up-to-date.

   At the moment (1981), we have the Starlink Subroutine  Interface  (SUN/4) but no
   command language.
   This means each application program must run in isolation from all others and
   the unfortunate user is saddled with the endless specification of parameters and
   answering of prompts.

   program to communicate its results to another one.

%B The RV program produces a report listing the components, in a given
   direction, of the observer's velocity on a given date.  This allows an
   observed radial velocity to be referred to an appropriate standard of
   rest -- typically either the Sun or an LSR.

   As a secondary function, RV computes light time components to the Sun,
   thus allowing the times of phenomena observed from a terrestrial
   observatory to be referred to a heliocentric frame of reference.
   (n.b. It will of course, in addition, be necessary to express the
   observations in the appropriate timescale as well as applying light
   time corrections.  In particular, it is likely that an observed UTC
   will need to be converted to TDB as well as being corrected to the

%J Starlink User Note 83
%B This note describes the release on Starlink of the RAL/ICL GKS graphics
   package. GKS has two major advantages over other graphics packages:

   o It is an international standard and real portability of graphics software
     is now possible. An illustration of this is that the NCAR
     package---an extensive library of scientific graphics utilities produced by the
     National Center for Atmospheric Research in the USA---runs on the RAL/ICL GKS
     without any modification, despite the fact that it was developed using a
     completely independent GKS implementation.

   o No other package provides the ability to write device independent graphics
     programs to the extent that GKS does.
     Only with GKS can you write a program that will run, and produce good pictures,
     on all devices supported by the implementation, including devices not supported
     at the time the program was written.
     Programs can nonetheless still fully exploit all the facilities offered by the
     hardware.

%A Rees, P. C. T.; Bly, M. J.; Terrett, D. L.

%J Starlink User Note 88
%B The National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado has,
   for many years, distributed a extensive suite of high level graphics
   utilities.  When NCAR converted these utilities to run over the ISO
   standard GKS, Starlink was used as a test site.  Starlink was
   subsequently given permission to release the NCAR utilities as part of
   the Starlink Software Collection.  The NCAR utilities offer an
   alternative high level graphics package to PGPLOT (SUN/15)
   for use within Starlink applications.  The NCAR package is arguably more
   powerful than PGPLOT in functionality and flexibility, but it does
   require a little more time to master.  Starlink provides a set of
   extensions to the NCAR graphics utilities, SNX (SUN/90), to make the
   use of NCAR more accessible to the beginner.  For lower level work, SGS
   (SUN/85) or GKS (SUN/83) should be used.

%T SNX -- Starlink Extensions to the NCAR Graphics Utilities
%A Rees, P. C. T.; Bly, M. J.; Wallace, P. T.
%D 00/1995
%J Starlink User Note 90
%B The NCAR graphics suite (SUN/88) consists of a set of subprograms which
   can be used to produce complete graphs in a variety of formats.  The
   package has been in wide use for some years; the latest version employs
   the ISO standard GKS interfaces for its low-level plotting, giving it
   access to all Starlink graphics devices, present and future.

   The NCAR routines themselves are thoroughly documented, and just a few
   simple calls will produce graphs of excellent appearance.  The package
   also provides a high level of flexibility, with dozens of different
   details of the plot independently controllable to give exactly the
   result required.  However, beginners may be daunted by the mass of
   features offered, and unless they take the extreme step of reading the
   manual may give up before they realise what the package can do for
   them.  This document describes minor extensions which provide more
   convenient access to certain features without sacrificing flexibility.

   The AUTOGRAPH part of the NCAR suite, used in conjunction with the
   Starlink NCAR extensions and the Starlink low level plotting package
   SGS (SUN/85), offers an alternative high level system to PGPLOT
   (SUN/15) for producing graphs of one variable plotted against another.
   All of the Starlink extensions provided within SNX enhance the power of
   the facilities provided by AUTOGRAPH and make it more accessible to the
   beginner.

%D 00/2008
%J Starlink User Note 92
%B HDS is a file-based hierarchical data system designed for the storage
   of a wide variety of information. It is particularly suited to the
   storage of large multi-dimensional arrays (with their ancillary data)
   where efficient access is needed.

   HDS organises data into hierarchies, broadly
   similar to the directory structure of a hierarchical filing system,
   but contained within a single HDS container file. The structures
   stored in these files are self-describing and flexible; HDS supports
   modification and extension of structures previously created, as well
   as deletion, copying, renaming, etc.

   All information stored in HDS files is portable between the machines
   on which HDS is implemented. Thus, there are no format conversion
   problems when moving between machines.

   The routines described in this document
   may be used to perform operations on any HDS data. In addition, HDS
   forms a toolkit for the construction of higher level (more
   specialised) data structures and the software which accesses them.
   HDS routines are therefore invoked indirectly by many other items of
   Starlink software.

   general-purpose commands for image processing, data visualisation, and
   manipulation of the standard Starlink data format---the NDF.  It is
   intended to work in conjunction with Starlink's various specialised
   packages.

   In addition to the NDF, KAPPA can also process data in
   other formats by using the `on-the-fly' conversion scheme.  Many
   commands can process data arrays of arbitrary dimension, and others
   work on both spectra and images. KAPPA operates from
   both the UNIX C-shell and the ICL command language.

   This document describes how to use KAPPA and its
   features.  There is some description of techniques too, including a
   section on writing scripts.  This document includes several tutorials
   and is illustrated with numerous examples.  The bulk of this document
   comprises detailed descriptions of each command as well as classified
   and alphabetical summaries.

%T HDSTRACE -- Listing HDS Data Files
%A Currie, Malcolm J.
%D 00/1993
%J Starlink User Note 102
%B One of the most popular features of the ADAM environment is the
   Hierarchical Data System (HDS) (described in SUN/92 and SG/4).   HDS
   enables associated data items to be stored together in a single file and
   in a structured fashion.  HDS is also highly flexible, allowing a myriad
   of ways to organise your data.  So HDS is jolly useful, but it does have
   one drawback---you cannot just type or print an HDS file to see its
   contents---you must run a programme.  Obviously, you (or your friendly
   programmer) could write some code to list a particular structure, but
   this would be inefficient given the number of structures that are
   already in use, let alone the ones to come.  What is required is a
   single utility that lists the contents of an HDS data structure to your
   terminal and, optionally, to a file for printing or documentation. This
   is where HDSTRACE comes in handy.

%J Starlink User Note 103
%B APIG, Absorption Profiles in the Interstellar Gas, is a package to
   perform analysis of the interstellar
   absorption lines detected in the spectra of Galactic and extragalactic
   sources. When observed with sufficiently high resolution, these lines
   often show a complex structure with multiple components formed in
   absorbing regions at different velocities along the line of sight. The
   main purpose of the program is to determine the column density of
   absorbers along the line of sight from an interactive analysis of the
   equivalent widths and profiles of the observed absorption lines. In
   cases where the line profiles are resolved the velocity structure
   of the absorbing material is also determined

   APIG is not a reduction system for astronomical spectra. It assumes
   that the raw spectra have already been reduced to produce wavelength
   calibrated spectra normalised relative to the background continuum and
   that equivalent widths have been determined.

%J Starlink User Note 148
%B This note describes a small set of programs, written at RGO, which deal with
   basic CCD frame processing (e.g. bias subtraction, flat fielding, trimming
   etc.).  The need to process large numbers of CCD frames from devices such as
   FOS or ISIS in order to extract spectra has prompted the writing of routines
   which will do the basic hack-work with a minimal amount of interaction from the
   user. Although they were written with spectral data in mind, there are no
   ``spectrum-specific'' features in the software which means they can be applied
   to any CCD data.

   extraction of spectra from two dimensional data frames.  The need to extract
   spectra from two dimensional frames in an optimal manner (e.g. one in which the
   signal to noise ratio was maximised) was the primary reason for the writing of
   the package. The programs were originally written with FOS, ISIS and IDS in
   mind, but contain nothing which  is instrument specific and hence should be
   applicable to any two dimensional spectral data frame.

   By using the MAG routines, a program can read and write tapes, position the
   tape (both in absolute terms and relative to the current position) and can
   control the allocation of the tape drive and the physical mounting of the tape
   on systems which provide that facility.

   The library is currently supported for Sun Sparcstations running Solaris and
   for DEC Alphas running OSF/1. Historically it has been supported for DEC
   Ultrix and for SunOS and may still work for them.

   The library is also available for VAX/VMS systems.

%B This document describes a set of ``Hypertext Cross-Reference
   Utilities'' (HTX) which are designed to help maintain large
   documentation sets whose constituent documents are written
   using the Hypertext Markup Languagee (HTML).

   The central part of HTX is a hypertext linker, hlink.
   This allows hyper-links (or cross-references)
   to be established between related documents in such a way that it is
   easy to maintain their integrity as individual documents are updated.
   Information produced by this linking process is also used by other HTX
   utilities to provide document
   search facilities and the ability to
   randomly access any part of a
   documentation set. This latter capability forms a basis for
   constructing hypertext help systems for
   use by other software.

   The expected readership of this document includes those who read
   hypertext documentation, those who write it, and those who maintain
   it, especially those who write and maintain Starlink
   documentation. Software developers may also be interested in
   the possibilities for hypertext help that HTX provides.

%B The NRAO Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) is a software
   package for interactive (and, optionally, batch) calibration and
   editing of radio interferometric data and for the calibration,
   construction, display and analysis of astronomical images made from
   those data using Fourier synthesis methods.  It is the principle tool
   for display and analysis of both two- and three-dimensional radio
   images (i.e., continuum ``maps'' and spectral-line ``cubes''
   from the NRAO's Very Large Array (VLA) as well as MERLIN data.

   It is also used for astronomical applications that do not involve radio
   interferometry.  These uses include the display and analysis of line
   and continuum data from large single-dish radio surveys, and the
   processing of image data at infrared, visible, ultraviolet and X-ray
   wavelengths.

%B During 1990 Jul to 1991 Jan, the ROSAT Wide Field Camera (WFC) performed
   the first all-sky survey at extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths.
   The whole sky, or approximately 96% of it, was imaged in two passbands, S1
   and S2, covering the ranges 60-140 Angstroms and 110-200 Angstroms respectively.
   An initial bright source catalogue (BSC) of 383 sources was produced by
   Pounds et al.  A new list, the 2RE Catalogue,
   of 479 sources has recently been
   published.  The survey data i.e., images and `raw' photon event files
   are now in the public domain.  The REPACK software package has been
   developed to fully exploit these data.  This document describes the
   REPACK programs.

   close to the target object being observed.  This manual describes how to
   find such guide stars.  It documents the NAOS package whose purpose is
   precisely to find suitable guide stars and also describes various related
   items of software.  Details of the potential guide stars are produced as
   tabular lists in text files, finding charts and tables in a format
   suitable for input into GAIA or CURSA.

   This document is aimed at astronomers who are planning to observe
   with the NAOMI adaptive optics system on the WHT and need to find guide
   stars for their target objects.

%B XRT is a package for reducing data acquired with the ROSAT XRT

   payload of the ROSAT X-ray astronomy satellite.  The XRT had two
   instruments: the PSPC (Position Sensitive Proportional Counter) and the
   HRI (High Resolution Imager).  The XRT package operates on data produced
   by these instruments and can be used to transform them into calibrated
   images, spectra, time-series etc.

   XRT was created by taking the ROSAT XRT-specific functions in the ASTERIX
   general X-ray astronomy data reduction system and re-packaging them as
   stand-alone applications.

%T STIL - Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library
%A Taylor, Mark
%D 00/2013
%J Starlink User Note 252
%B STIL is a set of Java class libraries which allow input,
   manipulation and output of tabular data and metadata. Among its key
   features are support for many tabular formats (including VOTable,
   FITS, CDF, text-based formats and SQL databases) and support for
   dealing with very large tables in limited memory.

   As well as an abstract and format-independent definition of what
   constitutes a table, and an extensible framework for "pull-model"
   table processing, it provides a number of format-specific handlers
   which know how to serialize/deserialize tables. The framework for
   interaction between the core table manipulation facilities and the
   format-specific handlers is open and pluggable, so that handlers
   for new formats can easily be added, programmatically or at
   run-time.

   The VOTable handling in particular is provided by classes which
   perform efficient XML parsing and can read and write VOTables in
   any of the defined formats (TABLEDATA, BINARY or FITS). It supports
   table-aware SAX- or DOM-mode processing and may be used on its own
   for VOTable I/O without much reference to the format-independent
   parts of the library.

%T TOPCAT -- Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables
%A Taylor, Mark
%D 00/2013
%J Starlink User Note 253
%B TOPCAT is an interactive graphical viewer and editor for tabular
   data. It has been designed for use with astronomical tables such as
   object catalogues, but is not restricted to astronomical
   applications. It understands a number of different astronomically
   important formats, and more formats can be added. It is designed to
   cope well with large tables; a million rows by a hundred columns
   should not present a problem even with modest memory and CPU
   resources.

   It offers a variety of ways to view and analyse the data, including
   a browser for the cell data themselves, viewers for information
   about table and column metadata, tools for joining tables using
   flexible matching algorithms, and visualisation facilities
   including histograms, 2- and 3-dimensional scatter plots, and
   density maps. Using a powerful and extensible Java-based expression
   language new columns can be defined and row subsets selected for
   separate analysis. Selecting a row can be configured to trigger an
   action, for instance displaying an image of the catalogue object in
   an external viewer. Table data and metadata can be edited and the
   resulting modified table can be written out in a wide range of
   output formats.

   A number of options are provided for loading data from external
   sources, including Virtual Observatory (VO) services, thus
   providing a gateway to many remote archives of astronomical
   data. It can also interoperate with other desktop tools using the
   SAMP protocol.

   TOPCAT is written in pure Java and is available under the GNU
   General Public Licence. Its underlying table processing facilities
   are provided by STIL, the Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library.

%B STILTS is a set of command-line tools for processing tabular data.
   It has been designed for, but is not restricted to, use on
   astronomical data such as source catalogues.  It contains both
   generic (format-independent) table processing tools and tools for
   processing VOTable documents.  Facilities offered include
   crossmatching, format conversion, format validation, column
   calculation and rearrangement, row selection, sorting, plotting,
   statistical calculations and metadata display.  Calculations on
   cell data can be performed using a powerful and extensible
   expression language.

   The package is written in pure Java and based on STIL, the Starlink
   Tables Infrastructure Library.  This gives it high portability,
   support for many data formats (including FITS, VOTable, text-based
   formats and SQL databases), extensibility and scalability.  Where
   possible the tools are written to accept streamed data so the size
   of tables which can be processed is not limited by available
   memory.  As well as the tutorial and reference information in this
   document, detailed on-line help is available from the tools
   themselves.

   thought by many to be unsatisfactory. The purpose of this document is to outline
   the procedures to be followed by the person discovering the bug, the Starlink
   Software Librarian and the person to whom the bug is reported. In the past,
   bug reports have seemed to disappear down a black hole, with a fix (maybe)
   appearing, without warning, sometime later. This was generally due to a lack of
   communication on all parts and it is hoped that the procedures outlined below
   will keep all users informed of the progress of a bug through the system.

%J Starlink General Paper 7
%B In order to exploit the most cost-effective hardware and to
   maintain compatibility with the international community, Starlink has
   begun introducing Unix-based computers.  A mixed Unix/VMS service, with
   its extra system management and software support costs, will not be
   efficient in the long term, and over the next few years the existing
   VMS service will run down and a complete change to Unix will occur.
   The details and timing of this transition will vary from site to site in
   accordance with local needs and conditions.  However, as far as possible
   all future hardware purchases will be Unix-based.  As representatives of
   the user community, the Starlink Users' Committee has worked closely
   with the Project in formulating these plans and firmly endorses them.

   The experiment was successful in that we succeeded in running a KAPPA
   application (ADD) as a module in an AVS network without modifying the
   applications program code in any way. We took many short cuts and it became
   clear that doing the job properly would be a major exercise, but we
   learned enough to know that the job is feasible and gained a clear idea of
   what the final system would look like and what it would be capable of.

%A Dickens, R. J.; Fosbury, R. A. E.; Wallace, P. T.; Lawden, M. D.
%D 00/1987
%J Starlink General Paper 13
%B he purpose of this paper is to announce to the astronomical community the
   present plans for the development of applications software within Starlink.
   The paper follows widespread consultation with astronomers---through a survey
   carried out in December 1979, visits to many university departments and
   establishments during the first half of 1980 and a workshop held in June 1980.
   In some areas we can be more specific than others and no doubt plans and
   priorities will undergo major revision as time passes.
   We believe that widespread and up-to-date knowledge of the intentions and
   progress of work on applications is essential if we are effectively to harness
   the effort and expertise available amongst UK astronomers and to maintain
   uniformity of style and high standards everywhere.
   Comments on these proposals and continual feedback as Starlink develops will
   therefore be greatly appreciated.

   requirements for Starlink-supported applications software but are equally
   appropriate for private programming.  The standard applies mainly
   to the implementation of freestanding VAX/VMS and Unix
   applications, but also includes some material specific to developing
   programs for the Starlink ADAM Software Environment.

   Most of the recommendations made here have been available since
   the appearance of the first edition in June 1981.
   Apart from a few additions in August 1984, Starlink's advice
   on general FORTRAN coding standards has not changed.
   Recent versions of this document
   have contained additional material on use
   of graphics and on writing ADAM applications.

   to set up committees much like the old LMCs or AMCs, but adapted
   to suit local needs.

   A prospective Site Chairman proposes and agrees with the Starlink

   Essentially, we aim to use PCs as low-end multi-user
   workstations running Linux, a variant of Unix, and to
   integrate them with existing Unix systems.  We also aim to
   make most Starlink software available for the PC/Linux
   platform.

   Starlink's policy on support of PCs is likely to develop
   over the next few years.  Readers are therefore advised
   to check that they have the most up-to-date version of this
   document.  The policy outlined here was agreed by the
   Starlink Panel at their meeting in March 1996.

%J Starlink General Paper 50
%B This document describes the various styles which are recommended for Starlink
   documents.
   It also explains how to use the templates which are provided by
   Starlink to help authors create documents in a standard style.

   This paper is concerned mainly with conveying the ``look and feel" of the
   various styles of Starlink document rather than describing the technical
   details of how to produce them.
   Other Starlink papers give recommendations for the detailed
   aspects of document production, design, layout, and typography.

   The only style that is likely to be used by most Starlink authors is the
   Standard style.

%A Bly, M. J.; Warren-Smith, R. F.
%D 00/1997
%J Starlink General Paper 51
%B This document sets out the steps involved in maintaining and developing
   the Starlink Software Collection.  The intended audience is all those
   involved in maintenance and development of Starlink software.   Some
   sections will be of particular relevance to programmers while other
   sections will be of interest to those involved in software
   distribution.

   It details the process from the passing of a bug report to the support
   programmer through to the final release of a fix to a package.  It also
   specifies the steps required for handling a new package, porting of
   existing packages to new platforms, and developing updates to
   packages.

   There are also sections on beta-testing packages, and the production of
   CD-ROMs.

   It does not cover Base Set software, nor does it detail the use of
   Starlink standard makefiles, and does not specify the mechanics of the
   procedures, which evolve with operational demands.

   The new scheme is based on a twice-yearly release of the whole Unix
   Starlink Software Collection (USSC) on CD-ROM backed up by releases of
   bug fixes using the Starlink Software Store.  Development versions of
   the USSC will be maintained at RAL and made available to sites hosting
   contract programmers.  Information files and management documentation
   will be distributed monthly using a simplified version of the current
   distribution system.  Commercial software will be distributed using a
   modified version of the current distribution system, to coincide with
   CD-ROM releases.

   These routines were specified by the workshop on data acquisition environments
   held at AAO in October 1985. The routines provide a fast, general means of
   synchronous communication between VMS processes. They are used by version
   2.0 of the ADAM system to provide the low level message system facilities.
   However, the routines form an independent package which does not require
   the existence of any other parts of the ADAM system. Thus they could be used
   for any application which requires fast interprocess communication.

%J Starlink System Note 4
%B This document describes the Error Message
   Service, EMS, and its use in system software.
   The purpose of EMS is to provide facilities for constructing and storing
   error messages for future delivery to the user -- usually via the Starlink
   Error Reporting System, ERR (see SUN/104).
   EMS can be regarded as a simplified version of ERR without the binding to
   any software environment (e.g., for message output or access to the
   parameter and data systems).
   The routines in this library conform to the error reporting conventions
   described in SUN/104.
   A knowledge of these conventions, and of the ADAM system
   (see SG/4), is assumed in what follows.

   This document is intended for Starlink systems programmers and can safely be

%A Clayton, C. A.

%B Starlink uses a variety of 1600/6250 bpi tape drives at its various sites.
   These include the SI 9621, the CDC Keystone 3, the Cipher M990 and one or two
   other drives.
   Starlink currently has Cipher M990 tape drives at Manchester, Leicester, ROE,
   Cambridge, Birmingham, Armagh, Belfast, Oxford, UCL, Southampton, St. Andrews,
   Sussex, Cardiff and QMW. The majority of these are controlled by Dilog DQ153
   and DQ3153 controllers. Managers as
   sites which do not have one of these controllers and who
   are unhappy with the functionality of their present controller should contact
   the author.

   This document is aimed at Site Managers and describes how to make the most of
   their Cipher M990s. Some of these devices have not been optimally set-up by
   engineers and some simple tuning may improve performance dramatically.
   This document does not attempt to explain
   to users how to use the drive since this is almost impossible to do this
   without complex diagrams and it is far more effective for a Site Manager to
   actually demonstrate the procedures to new users.

%T Adding Format Conversion Facilities to the NDF Data Access Library
%A Warren-Smith, R. F.; Berry, D. S.
%D 00/2000
%J Starlink System Note 20
%B The NDF (Extensible N-Dimensional Data Format) data access
   library (SUN/33) provides a programming interface and
   a data model for astronomical applications software. It is based on a
   flexible underlying data format HDS (SUN/92) and a set
   of conventions for structuring data within HDS.

   This document describes facilities for extending the range of data
   formats accessible via the NDF library, to include any arbitrary
   ``foreign'' format for which a conversion utility can be defined.
   This gives NDF-based applications access to a potentially wide range
   of data formatting possibilities, including data compression.

   The intended readership of this document includes:
   - Developers working with data formats and associated conversion
     utilities,
   - Programmers who anticipate using the NDF library to access foreign data,
   - Knowledgeable users who need to access data stored in new
     (e.g., personal) formats.

%T STARX -- X Library linking
%A Bly, M. J.

%J Starlink System Note 21
%B The STARX Starlink Environment package provides a system independent
   method of linking with the X libraries, to relieve the other
   subroutines libraries and applications of having to worry about the
   various complications involved.

   STARX allows the X Library linking strategy to be changed easily, without
   changing any of the other Starlink Environment components.

   The system described has been tested for DEC AXP/Digital Unix, Sun
   Sparc/SunOS4, Sun Sparc/Solaris (version 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5), and Intel
   PC/Linux.  It does not appear to hinder dynamic linking where

%T A Starlink Guide to Cartridge Tape Subsystems
%A Duffey, K. P.
%D 00/1995
%J Starlink System Note 31
%B Various data storage solutions have been adopted by the Starlink Project,
   including SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) Winchester Disks and
   different types of magnetic tape storage.

   SCSI Winchester Disk devices are representative of Primary Data Storage,
   where data is maintained online, and may be accessed randomly. Secondary
   Data Storage is removable data storage; data is only accessible when the
   media has been inserted in the appropriate device as, for example with
   floppy disk drives. Backup Data Storage generally works sequentially, and is
   often represented by Magnetic Tape Subsystems.

   This guide is concerned with Backup Data Storage, and sets out to highlight
   the similarities and differences between the three tape options most
   commonly selected for Starlink applications: DAT (Digital Audio Tape),
   Exabyte and DLT (Digital Linear Tape). The purpose of this guide is to
   provide a helpful starting-point for anyone seeking to know more about one

%A Huckle, H. E.; Clayton, C. A.
%D 00/1989
%J Starlink System Note 65
%B VSHC works when a detached process is run at boot time which runs a .EXE file that creates a
   permanent mailbox and redefines UIS$PRINT_DESTINATION to that mailbox. The
   program then goes into an infinite loop which includes a read to that mailbox.
   When a hardcopy is initiated, sixel graphics commands are sent to
   UIS$PRINT_DESTINATION and thus go to the mailbox. The program then reads those
   graphics commands from the mailbox and interprets them into equivalent Canon
   commands, using a `State Machine' technique to determine how far it's got, i.e.
   is it a start of a plot, end of plot, middle of plot, next plot etc. It spools
   the file of Canon graphics commands thus created (in VSHC_SCRATCH:), to a queue
   pointed at by the logical name VSHC_QUEUE. UIS$PRINT_DESTINATION can be
   mysteriously reset to its default value of CSA0: and so every few minutes an
   AST timeout occurs to reset UIS$PRINT_DESTINATION.

   Similar facilities are also available in other packages, such as the

   This functionality is achieved by having servers running on the remote
   systems which accept queries sent by GAIA etc, interrogate their
   local copies of the catalogues to find the data which satisfy the query
   and return them.  The servers can communicate with GAIA etc. because
   the query is sent, and the results returned, in a standard format.  This

%T The Starlink Build System
%A Gray, Norman; Draper, Peter W.; Taylor, Mark B.; Rankin, Steven E.
%D 00/2005
%J Starlink System Note 78
%B This document provides an introduction to the Starlink build
   system.  It describes how to use the Starlink versions of the GNU
   autotools (autoconf, automake and libtool), how to build the software
   set from a checkout, how to add and configure new components, and acts
   as a reference manual for the Starlink-specific autoconf macros and
   Starlink automake features.

   It does not describe the management of the CVS repository in
   detail, nor any other source maintainance patterns.

   It should be read in conjunction with the detailed build
   instructions in the README file at the top of the source
   tree (which takes precedence over any instructions in this document,
   though there should be no major disagreements), and with SUN/248,
   which additionally includes platform-specific notes.

%B This document is aimed at users of HDS who wish to know something about how it
   is implemented, and at system programmers who are contemplating maintaining,
   altering or adding new facilities to HDS. The reader is assumed to be familiar
   with the VMS operating system, but no prior knowledge of HDS is assumed
   (although the material will be easier to assimilate if he has used it as an
   application programmer).

   This is not an exhaustive document and, as is often the case, the ultimate
   documentation is the code. However, all of the major concepts are discussed
   here and anybody wishing seriously to get to grips with the internals of
   HDS should definitely read it.

%Z This cookbook is intended for users of the JCMT
   and its common-user bolometer UKT14.
   It is intended as an introductory guide to the JCMT Data Reduction
   software package JCMTDR,
   which has been designed to replace the NOD2
   software package for reduction of dual-beam on-the-fly
   continuum maps. It is hoped that users who are new to the telescope
   as well as users already familiar with NOD2 will benefit from this
   cookbook. It tries to guide the user through the data reduction
   process and should be an aid to
   getting started in producing maps from raw dual-beam data.

%J Starlink Cookbook 2
%B IBM DX (Data Explorer) is the
   data-visualisation package recommended by Starlink, particularly for
   the visualisation of three-dimensional scalar and vector data. This
   cookbook provides a set of simple recipes for performing common
   operations using DX. No prior knowledge of DX is required. You can use
   the recipes as they are provided, if they are suitable for your
   purposes, or alternatively you can use them as a starting point for
   generating your own visualisations.

   The cookbook also contains a brief summary of the DX data model. It is
   useful to have at least some understanding of this data model in order
   to use DX effectively.

%T Echelle Data Reduction Cookbook
%A Clayton, Martin

%B This document is the first version of the Starlink Echelle Data
   Reduction Cookbook.  It contains scripts and procedures developed by
   regular or heavy users of the existing software packages.  These scripts
   are generally of two types; templates which readers may be able to
   modify to suit their particular needs and utilities which carry out
   a particular common task and can probably be used `off-the-shelf'.

   In the nature of this subject the recipes given are quite strongly tied
   to the software packages, rather than being science-data led.  The major
   part of this document is divided into two sections dealing with scripts to
   be used with IRAF and with Starlink software (SUN/1).

%B This cookbook describes the fundamentals of writing scripts using
   the UNIX C shell.  It shows how to combine Starlink and private applications
   with shell commands and constructs to create powerful and time-saving
   tools for performing repetitive jobs, creating data-processing
   pipelines, and encapsulating useful recipes.  The cookbook aims to give
   practical and reassuring examples to at least get you started without
   having to consult a UNIX manual.  However, it does not offer a
   comprehensive description of C-shell syntax to prevent you from
   being overwhelmed or intimidated.  The topics covered are: how to run a
   script, defining shell variables, prompting, arithmetic and string
   processing, passing information between Starlink applications, obtaining
   dataset attributes and FITS header information, processing multiple
   files and filename modification, command-line arguments and options, and
   loops.  There is also a glossary.

%T The 2-d CCD Data Reduction Cookbook
%A Davenhall, A. C.; Privett, G. J.; Taylor, M. B.
%D 00/2001
%J Starlink Cookbook 5
%B This cookbook presents simple recipes and scripts for reducing direct
   images acquired with optical CCD detectors.  Using these recipes and
   scripts you can correct un-processed images obtained from CCDs for
   various instrumental effects to retrieve an accurate picture of the
   field of sky observed.  The recipes and scripts use standard software
   available at all Starlink sites.

   The topics covered include: creating and applying bias and flat-field
   corrections, registering frames and creating a stack or mosaic of
   registered frames.  Related auxiliary tasks, such as converting between
   different data formats, displaying images and calculating image statistics
   are also presented.

   In addition to the recipes and scripts, sufficient background material
   is presented to explain the procedures and techniques used.  The
   treatment is deliberately practical rather than theoretical, in keeping
   with the aim of providing advice on the actual reduction of observations.
   Additional material outlines some of the differences between using
   conventional optical CCDs and the similar arrays used to observe at
   infrared wavelengths.

%T The CCD Photometric Calibration Cookbook
%A Palmer, J.; Davenhall, A. C.
%D 00/2001
%J Starlink Cookbook 6
%B This cookbook presents simple recipes for the photometric calibration
   of CCD frames.  Using these recipes you can calibrate the brightness
   of objects measured in CCD frames into magnitudes in standard
   photometric systems, such as the Johnson-Morgan UBV, system.
   The recipes use standard software available at all Starlink sites.

   The topics covered include: selecting standard stars, measuring
   instrumental magnitudes and calibrating instrumental magnitudes into a
   standard system.  The recipes are appropriate for use with data acquired
   with optical CCDs and filters, operated in standard ways, and describe the
   usual calibration technique of observing standard stars.  The software
   is robust and reliable, but the techniques are usually not suitable where
   very high accuracy is required.

   In addition to the recipes and scripts, sufficient background material
   is presented to explain the procedures and techniques used.  The
   treatment is deliberately practical rather than theoretical, in keeping
   with the aim of providing advice on the actual calibration of observations.

   This cookbook is aimed firmly at people who are new to astronomical
   photometry.  Typical readers might have a set of photometric observations
   to reduce (perhaps observed by a colleague) or be planning a programme of
   photometric observations, perhaps for the first time.  No prior knowledge
   of astronomical photometry is assumed.

   The cookbook is not aimed at experts in astronomical photometry.  Many
   finer points are omitted for clarity and brevity.  Also, in order to
   make the most accurate possible calibration of high-precision photometry,
   it is usually necessary to use bespoke software tailored to the
   observing programme and photometric system you are using.

   of data reduction recipes are available to ORAC-DR for use when
   working with scuba maps, these recipes utilize the SURF and KAPPA packages.

   This cookbook makes no attempts to explain why and how, for that there
   is a comprehensive Starlink User Note 216 which properly documents all the software tasks in SURF,
   which should be consulted for those who need to know details of a
   task, or how the task really works.

%T The GAIA Cookbook
%A Davenhall, A. C.; Draper, P. W.
%D 00/2001
%J Starlink Cookbook 17
%B GAIA (Graphical Astronomy and Image Analysis) is an interactive
   astronomical image display and analysis tool.  It includes a comprehensive
   suite of facilities for displaying and manipulating images.  It also has
   extensive facilities for the astronomical analysis of images, including:
   astrometric calibration, automatic object detection and aperture, optimal
   and surface photometry.  GAIA can access images in most of the data formats
   common in astronomy and can also retrieve copies of remote images and
   catalogues via the Internet.

   This cookbook is an introduction to GAIA.  It describes the facilities
   that GAIA provides and gives some simple examples of their use.  It
   refers to GAIA version 2.6 or higher.

   This cookbook is aimed at astronomers who are new to GAIA, but who think
   that it might be useful in their work.  It is not aimed at experienced
   users of GAIA, for whom the GAIA manual (SUN/214) or the
   on-line help within GAIA itself might be more useful.

%D 00/2010
%J Starlink Cookbook 19
%B This cookbook provides a short introduction to \starlink\ facilities,
  especially \smurf, the Sub-Millimetre User Reduction Facility, for
  reducing and displaying SCUBA-2 SRO data. We describe some of the data
  artefacts present in SCUBA-2 time series and methods we employ to
  mitigate them. In particular, we illustrate the various steps
  required to reduce the data, and the Dynamic Iterative Map-Maker,
  which carries out all of these steps using a single command.

  For information on SCUBA-2 data reduction since SRO, please SC/21.
