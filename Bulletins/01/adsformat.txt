%B The Starlink user community is now approaching 900 in number, at
   eleven nodes and seven "mini-nodes" with a node in Northern Ireland
   the most recent addition.

   The Starlink "mission" to co-ordinate software and provide hardware
   for the UK astronomical community requires a great deal of
   consultation between the project staff and the users. This need is
   addressed in several ways: via special interest groups (SIGs);
   local user groups (SLUGs); area management committees (AMCs);
   Starlink site managers' meetings etc. This new Bulletin advertises
   the activities and plans of the Starlink Project, and gives the
   wider community a further opportunity to express its views.

   We thank all the contributors to this first issue and extend an
   invitation to the general Starlink user community to contribute to
   forthcoming editions. (We prefer text files sent through the
   electronic MAIL.) The Starlink Bulletin comprises a collection of
   articles from many different sources. Hence the views expressed do not
   necessarily reflect those of Starlink management.

   At the end of each article the Starlink DECnet 'MAIL' address and
   the NRS address of the author are given.

%B The UK astronomical community is developing a software environment
   called ADAM for use in both data acquisition (at LPO, JCMT and AAO)
   and for data analysis (notably on Starlink; also for the UK ROSAT
   data analysis).

%B Starlink envisages a kernel of general-purpose software that all users
   of the Starlink software collection will require, and many associated
   or specialised items which would be optional. The kernel will include
   the environment, ADAM; libraries like GKS, HDS, and also general-purpose
   applications. To this end KAPPA (Kernel Application Package) is being
   developed.

%B The purpose of the Starlink Special Interest Groups (SIGs) is to
   provide a forum at which the software requirements of various
   groups of astronomers can be discussed and priorities for
   software development can be determined. Eight SIGs exist at
   present, namely the Spectroscopic, IUE, HST, IRAS, 2-D, X-ray,
   Radio and Database SIGs, and reports from four of them follow. All
   except the HST SIG now have an associated applications programmer
   who will endeavour to fulfil what the SIGs identify as the most
   pressing software needs.

%B The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) SIG was formed in August 1986. Our
   aim is to see that the needs of the UK community likely to be using
   HST data are provided through Starlink. It was generally felt that,
   until the large delays resulting from Challenger, the data analysis
   facilities available here would have been sorely stretched by HST
   requirements. With launch now unlikely before the beginning of 1989
   at the earliest, we have the opportunity to see that UK astronomers
   do have access to adequate data-processing resources and are able to
   benefit from the very large HST data-bank that will accumulate.
